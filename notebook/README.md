## Training an ML Model on Historical Minute Bar Data

This example showcases the power of Amazon SageMaker in training an XGBoost model (or any time series model, such as GluonTS) using historical minute bar data. With just a few lines of Python code, you can leverage SageMaker's managed Jupyter notebook instance and distributed training capabilities to efficiently train your model on large datasets.

## Backtesting the ML Model

After training your ML model, it's crucial to evaluate its performance through backtesting. This process not only validates the model's effectiveness but also helps derive a robust trading strategy. SageMaker streamlines the backtesting process by allowing you to load historical minute bar data and run your backtesting code seamlessly within the managed Jupyter notebook environment.
