# Quant research with Amazon SageMaker

As a quant researcher, speed and efficiency are paramount. SageMaker provides fully managed Jupyter notebooks that allow you to focus on your analysis without worrying about infrastructure. You can scale your models effortlessly with SageMakerâ€™s distributed training capabilities. With just a few lines of Python code, you can harness almost unlimited compute power, reducing training time from days to hours.

This example demonstrates how to load historical minute bar data and train an XGBoost model easily on SageMaker. After training your XGBoost model, you want to back test it to derive a trading strategy. This also demonstrates how to load historical minute bar data and back test the XGBoost model easily on SageMaker.
